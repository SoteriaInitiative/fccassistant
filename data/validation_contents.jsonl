An entity is considered blocked if it is owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate by one or more blocked persons.\n\nCo A's aggregate ownership by blocked persons is 50%, calculated as follows:\n\n- 3% direct ownership by SDN A.\n- 47% ownership by Co B. Co B is itself a blocked entity because it is 42% owned by SDN B and 50% owned by SDN D via Co D.\n\nOther ownership interests:\n- 50% of Co A is owned by Co C, which is not a blocked entity but has partial ownership by SDN F (through Co E) that does not aggregate to 50% in Co C.\n\nTherefore, Co A meets the blocking threshold under OFAC's 50 Percent Rule and is considered blocked."}]}]}
