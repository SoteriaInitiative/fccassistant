OFAC urges persons considering a potential transaction to conduct appropriate due\ndiligence on entities that are party to or involved with the transaction or with which account relationships are\nmaintained in order to determine relevant ownership stakes. Please see FAQ 116 for additional guidance on due\ndiligence standards for intermediary parties to wire transfers. Please refer to the examples below for further\nguidance on determining whether an entity is blocked pursuant to OFAC's 50 Percent Rule.\nExample 1: Blocked Person X owns 50 percent of Entity A, and Entity A owns 50 percent of Entity B. Entity B is\nconsidered to be blocked. This is so because Blocked Person X owns, indirectly, 50% of Entity B. In addition,\nBlocked Person X's 50 percent ownership of Entity A makes Entity A a blocked person. Entity A's 50 percent\nownership of Entity B in turn makes Entity B a blocked person.\nExample 2: Blocked Person X owns 50 percent of Entity A and 50 percent of Entity B. Entities A and B each own\n25 percent of Entity C. Entity C is considered to be blocked. This is so because, through its 50 percent ownership\nof Entity A, Blocked Person X is considered to indirectly own 25 percent of Entity C; and through its 50 percent\nownership of Entity B, Blocked Person X is considered to indirectly own another 25 percent of Entity C. When\nBlocked Person X's indirect ownership of Entity C through Entity A and Entity B is totaled, it equals 50 percent.\nEntity C is also considered to be blocked due to the 50 percent aggregate ownership by Entities A and B, which\nare themselves blocked entities due to Blocked Person X's 50 percent ownership of each.\nExample 3: Blocked Person X owns 50 percent of Entity A and 10 percent of Entity B. Entity A also owns 40\npercent of Entity B. Entity B is considered to be blocked. This is so because, through its 50 percent ownership of\nEntity A, Blocked Person X is considered to indirectly own 40 percent of Entity B. When added to Blocked Person\n8/6/25, 10:51 PM\n| Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control\nhttps://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/topic/1521/print\n2/4\n\nX's direct 10 percent ownership of Entity B, Blocked Person X's total ownership (direct and indirect) of Entity B is\n50 percent. Entity B is also blocked due to the 50 percent aggregate ownership by Blocked Person X and Entity\nA, which are themselves both blocked persons.\nExample 4: Blocked Person X owns 50 percent of Entity A and 25 percent of Entity B. Entities A and B each own\n25 percent of Entity C. Entity C is not considered to be blocked. This is so because, even though Blocked Person\nX is considered to indirectly own 25 percent of Entity C through its 50 percent ownership of Entity A, Entity B is\nnot 50 percent or more owned by Blocked Person X, and therefore Blocked Person X is not considered to\nindirectly own any of Entity C through its part ownership of Entity B. Blocked Person X's total ownership (direct\nand indirect) of Entity C therefore does not equal or exceed 50 percent. Entity A is itself a blocked person, but its\nownership of Entity C also does not equal or exceed 50 percent.\nExample 5: Blocked Person X owns 25 percent of Entity A and 25 percent of Entity B. Entities A and B each own\n50 percent of Entity C. Entity C is not considered to be blocked. This is so because Blocked Person X's 25 percent\nownership of each of Entity A and Entity B falls short of 50 percent.
